# Match Or Miss

A simple game where you click a symbol with the corresponding name.

It's set up to use CodeKit, so if you have that you're doing great! If not, all the coffee files in `src` need to be compiled and combined as `public/app.js`.

If you want to try it out with different assets, replace the existing `public/assets/*` with whatever images and `content.json` you want.
