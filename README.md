# Match Or Miss

A simple game where you click a symbol with the corresponding name.

It's set up to use CodeKit, so if you have that you're doing great! If not, all the coffee files in `src` need to be compiled and combined as `public/app.js`.

It includes the hydraulic symbol content set by default. If you want to try it out with a different content set, replace the existing `public/content/*` with whatever images and `content.json` you want.

Note: The `public/assets/` folder is now used for _application_ assets, not game content.
