# Match Or Miss

A simple game where you click a symbol with the corresponding name.

It's set up to use CodeKit, so if you have that then just open the project and hit **Preview**. If you don't have CK you can use pow(der): `cd` into the project folder and then `powder link`.

The hydraulic symbol content set is included by default. If you want to try it out with a different content set, replace the existing `public/content/*` with whatever images and `content.json` you want.

Note: The `public/assets/` folder is now used for _application_ assets, not game content.
